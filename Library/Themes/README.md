# Themes

This folder is where all your themes are stored. Most themes use ThemeName.theme folder, with IconBundles etc.


I will inlcude examples for everything, seperated by name on what they theme.



# Info.plist

A plist looks like this, where DISPLAY NAME is the name that Anemone will name the section. If you are splitting your theme into multiple sections, don't change this as they will all fall under the same drop-down menu in Anemone. 
```html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PackageName</key>
	<string>DISPLAY NAME</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
