# App Icons

To theme apps, except for clock because its special, use IconBundles, with the images named bundle.identifier.here-large.png, at least 180x180 px in size. 

An advantage to using Anemone, is that it can automatically resize the icons for you, unlike WinterBoard which requires specific sizes.



# Bundles

This is where you theme the clock images (background, hands, and center dot). I've included examples for you to base your images off of.



# IconBundles

This is where app icons are themed. I've included stock, and a few extra Apple apps as examples.
