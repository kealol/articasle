# App Icons

To theme apps, except for clock because its special, use IconBundles, with the images named bundle.identifier.here-large.png, at least 180x180 px in size. 

An advantage to using Anemone, is that it can automatically resize the icons for you, unlike WinterBoard which requires specific sizes.
