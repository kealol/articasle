Documentation for Anemone on iOS 10.

I will lay out the file system which Anemone uses, and, hopefully, provide enough information section.


# finding bundle identifiers

OffCorner has made [this](http://offcornerdev.com/bundleid.html) amazing website making it a lot easier to find 3rd party app's bundle identifiers.


# official documentation

Official documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/AnemoneTeam/Anemone/wiki), but this is for iOS 7-9 only.
